    Memoir is a flexible class for typesetting poetry, fiction, 
non-fiction and mathematical works as books, reports, articles or
manuscripts. Documents can use 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt, 14pt, or 17pt as the
normal fontsize and, if you have scalable fonts, 20pt, 25pt, 30pt, 36pt,
48pt, or 60pt sizes, or even larger. Many methods are provided to let 
you create your particular design. The class incorporates over 30 of the 
more popular packages.

    IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK THEM ON THE COMP.TEXT.TEX NEWSGROUP;
YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET FASTER AND BETTER ANSWERS THAN IF YOU EMAIL ME DIRECTLY
AS I AM AWAY MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.

    NOTE: In order to provide fixes for any problems that may arise
between major releases, you may find a file called mempatch.sty
which contains any current fixes for the memoir class. The class
will automatically include this so DO NOT \usepackage{mempatch}.
The Change lists below do not neccessarily note each release of
the patch or addendum files.

   NOTE: Similarly, there may be file(s) called memmanadd.(tex|pdf) which 
provides amendments to the current version of the User Manual.

   NOTE: If you are using the hyperref package dated earlier than 2006/11/15, 
use the memhfixc package after the hyperref package, e.g.,
...
\usepackage[...]{hyperref}
\usepackage{memhfixc}
...
Later versions of the hyperref package automatically load the memhfixc package.

    NOTE: The full User Manual (memman.pdf) is a large document approaching
600 pages in total. You do not need to print all of it, especially if you 
already have an earlier edition. Roughly speaking, the main portions are:
o Frontmatter: Preface, Toc, Introduction, Terminology  ~  35 pages
o Mainmatter: 
    Design and typography                               ~  60 pages
    Class commands and environments, etc.               ~ 335 pages
o Appendices: (La)Tex programming, Errors and warnings  ~  40 pages
o Backmatter:
    Command glossary                                    ~  40 pages
    Bibliography, indexes                               ~  50 pages


Changes (2009/02/06)

o Memoir v1.6180339d,e fixes a bug introduced by v1.6180339c

-- \makeheadwidth, \makerunningheadwidth and \makerunningfootwidth no longer 
   support the '+' syntax from the calc package.

-- under hyperref \nameref is now an alias for \titleref


Changes (2009/01/26)
o Memoir v1.6180339c released with minor bug fixes that could
  not be done via the patch file, plus some new functionality. The
  manual has NOT been updated and the changes are noted below.

-- New paper size options: `a0paper', `a1paper', `a2paper', `b0paper', 
   `b1paper', and `b2paper' for A0, A1, A2, B0,B1, and B2 size stock paper.

-- Macro \memoirpostopthook{} which is called after the options are
   processed but before anything else is done (like setting the page layout).
   As an example, you may define it as (before the \documentclass}
   command):
     \newcommand*{\memoirpostopthook}{%
       \setlength{\stockwidth}{<wid>}\setlength{\stockheight}{<ht>}}
     \documentclass[...]{memoir}
  to specify a stock paper size of <wid> by <ht> that is not provided by the 
  defined options.

-- New `portrait' option (default, the opposite of `landscape').

-- New command \setbinding{<length>} for a binding offset of <length>.

-- New commands: \setpagetm, \setpagetr, \setpagemr, \setpagebr, \setpagebm,
   \setpagecc to position a (smaller) page on a (larger) stock at the
   top-middle, top-right, middle-right, bottom-right, bottom-middle, and
   centered with respect to the stock.

   The macros are to be used instead of \settrimmedsize taking the
   same arguments.

-- New optional parameter in \makeheadwidth{<style>}[<footerwidth>]{<headerwidth>}
   to set the width of the <style>'s headers to <headerwidth> and the footers 
   to <headerwidth> or, if given, to <footerwidth>. The two widths can also
   be set individually using \makerunningheadwidth{<style>}{<length>}
   and similarly with \makerunningfootwidth. The lengths, if needed
   are stored in \styleheadrunwidth and \stylefootrunwidth.

-- New `showlocs' pagestyle, which is provided as an example of what can be
   done to show the positions of headers, footers, and the textblock (lines
   are drawn showing the header and footer vertical locations and a box is
   drawn around the text block. It is implemented by two zero-sized pictures:
   \framepichead which draws a line at the header location, and \framepictextfoot 
   which draws a frame around the textblock and a line at the footer location.
   Following the declaration \showheadfootlocoff the header/footer lines
   will not be drawn (\showheadfootlocon turns them on again), and following 
   the \showtextblocklocoff declaration the frame around the text block will 
   not be drawn (\showtextblocklocon turns it on again). If you want a box 
   around your text you could create your own pagestyle using \framepictextfoot
   and with the showlocs code as a starting point. 

-- New command \centerfloat is a version of \centering which centers a wide 
   float or other known width element with respect to the textblock. E.g.,
   \begin{table} \centerfloat \caption{A wide table} ... \end{table}

-- New command \sourceatright[<length>]{<short text>}. Use at the end of a
   paragraph to put <short text> flushright. If it is short enough it will
   go at the end of the last line preceded by at least <length> (default 2em)
   space, otherwise it is set (flushright) on the following line.

-- New macro \leftspringright{<lfrac>}{<rfrac>}{<ltext>}{<rtext>} sets
   <ltext> as a flushleft column, width <lfrac> of the textwidth, and <rtext> 
   as a flushright column, width <rfrac> of the textwidth, with 
   (1.0 - <lfrac> - <rfrac>) textwidth space between them. E.g.,
   \spring{0.4}{0.5}{On the left}{Right stuff}

-- Following the declaration \linenottooshort{<length>} paragraphs will be set:
   As normal but the last line will not be shorter than <length> (default 4em)

-- Using \russianpar instead of \par to end a paragraph causes it to be set
   following Russian typographic rules

-- Using \lastlinerulefill instead of \par to end a paragraph will be 
   cause any short line to be filled with a rule (\lastlineparrule) up to 
   the righthand margin.

-- Following the declaration \leftcenterright paragraphs will be set:
   First line raggedright, the last line raggedleft, and the remainder 
   centered. If you use this shape, set \everypar{} afterwards.

-- Following the declaration \justlastraggedleft paragraphs will be set:
   All lines normal except the last is raggedleft.

-- Following the declaration \raggedrightthenleft paragraphs will be set:
   First line raggedright and remainder raggedleft.

-- If you use the above unusual paragraph shapes then using \\ to break
   a line may give a surprising result. If so, you could try instead
   \atcentercr (a memoir macro) or \break (a standard LaTeX macro) to see 
   if the result is any better for you. In addition, just in case, memoir
   stores the original definitions of \\ and \par as \memorigdbs and
   \memorigpar respectively.

-- \titleref have been extended with a \titleref*, which under
   hyperref will provide the title but no link. Without hyperref, it
   is the same as \titleref

-- added hooks around the internals used by sidecaption,
   sidecontcaption, sidenamedlegend and sidelegend. They do nothing by
   default but can be used for something like this

   \makeatletter
   \newenvironment{sidecaption*}{
     \renewcommand\@mem@scap@beforehook{\checkoddpage\ifoddpage\else\raggedleft\fi}
     \renewcommand\@mem@scap@afterhook{\par}
     \begin{sidecaption}}
     {\end{sidecaption}}
   \makeatother

   which, if the user has placed the sidecaption on the outside in an
   twosided layout, then the figure will automatically be pushed
   towards the spine margin.



Changes (2008/08/23)
o memhfixc v1.10 released to fix problem with tex4ht
o NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING ELSE

Changes (2008/08/07)
o Memoir v1.6180339a released to fix extraneous spaces in footnotes
o NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING ELSE

Changes (2008/07/23)
o Memoir v1.6180339 released to cater for non-compatible changes in
  the hyperref package. It is highly unlikely that I will make any future
  changes to memoir with respect to hyperref modifications, instead hyperref
  can cater for memoir if necessary. All patches from mempatch v5.1 are 
  folded in.
o Mempatch package v6.0 released.
o INSIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE MANUAL (corrected typo in Figure 8.1 caption,
  added two persons to the Acknowledgements)

Changes (2008/07/12)
o Mempatch package v5.1 released with bug fixes for \DisemulatePackage
  and spacing of Part titles in the ToC.
o There was a mismatch between the general version of memman.pdf and the
  tds version. These are now the same. I took the opportunity to fix
  some very minor typos (perhaps no more than half a dozen words) in the 
  User Manual (if you have a printed copy of the seventh edition, it's not 
  worth printing the update)
o NO CHANGES TO THE CLASS

Changes (2008/06/02)
o Memoir class v1.618033 released with bug fixes for \feetbelowfloats
  and sidebar layout for the larger font sizes.
o NO CHANGES TO THE USER MANUAL

Changes (2008/05/27)
o Memoir class v1.61803 released incorporating all patches and comments about 
  v1.61803 beta. Major extensions are extended, or arbitrary, document font 
  sizes and provision of several styles of section headings.
o User Manual (memman), edition 7 released incorporating the contents of the
  Addendum. The part on typography has been extended and a glossary of memoir's
  commands and environments has been added.
o New (empty) version of mempatch.sty.

    This will be the last release for a considerable period of time. After 25
years in the USA we are moving back to the UK where there are grandchildren.
The process will probably involve at least 6 months in LaTeX limbo.
My definition of `considerable period' may imply decades.

Changes (2008/04/25)

o Move memoir.cls, the mem*.clo files and any mem*.sty file to locations 
  where LaTeX will find them (typically in a local texmf tree at 
  /tex/latex/memoir) and refresh the file database. 
  See the FAQ on CTAN at help/uk-tex-faq
  or http://www.tug.ac.uk/faq for more information on this.
