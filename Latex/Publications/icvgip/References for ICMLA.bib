	abstract = {In this paper, we describe a new algorithm for human face detection. The algorithm uses both color and shape analysis. Color analysis is based on the novel idea of fuzzy classification that manipulates ambiguity in colors; using this technique we can robustly classify skin region and non-skin region. In order to decide whether the skin region is a face or not, we test its shape by applying an edge detection using Canny operator and an ellipse detection using Hough transform. We show with experimental results how the important detection ratio makes our system an effective tool for face detection},

	abstract = {We propose in this paper a model based technique for the detection of human faces from rich still color images. Traditionally, color images are represented in the RGB color space. RGB space, however, is not only a 3-dimensional space but also includes brightness or luminance which is not a reliable criterion for skin separation. To avoid the effect of luminance, we propose to work in the chromatic or pure color space. Using such space, a Gaussian model for the skin color pixels is developed and a skin likelihood image is obtained. Such image is then transformed into a binary image using adaptive thresholding. Finally, bright regions satisfying certain "facial" properties are obtained followed by a template matching stage. The method presented here is shown to provide robust detection under different environments and found to achieve very satisfactory results when compared to traditional "mug shot" based approaches.},

The idea consists of first preprocessing the images using a state-of-the-art approach for skin modeling in order to determine the potential skin regions. Thus, a scanning of the whole image when searching for faces is avoided. Then, in contrast to the existing methods, we consider the fact that the skin detection step still may produce unsatisfactory results or even fail and therefore we apply an exhaustive search in and around the detected skin regions using a new gray scale based approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach inherits the speed from the color based methods and the efficiency from the gray scale based ones},

Unlike in face recognition, where the classes to be discriminated are different faces, in face detection, the two classes to be discriminated are "face area" and "non-face area". A novel approach to face detection is presented, which is based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) specially trained for the identification of faces from skin areas within the image plane, which were previously located using fuzzy logic rules. The performance of the whole system was tested using 137 color image scenes with various illumination conditions containing human faces. The images were taken with a common digital camera, at a resolution of 1280/spl times/960 pixels. The PNN coupled with the fuzzy logic rules become the basis for developing a computer-based face detection system, whose overall identification performance was 85.2\%. One limitation of the system is that it is. restricted only in detection of frontal human faces.},

	abstract = {Images containing faces are essential to intelligent vision-based human-computer interaction, and research efforts in face processing include face recognition, face tracking, pose estimation and expression recognition. However, many reported methods assume that the faces in an image or an image sequence have been identified and localized. To build fully automated systems that analyze the information contained in face images, robust and efficient face detection algorithms are required. Given a single image, the goal of face detection is to identify all image regions which contain a face, regardless of its 3D position, orientation and lighting conditions. Such a problem is challenging because faces are non-rigid and have a high degree of variability in size, shape, color and texture. Numerous techniques have been developed to detect faces in a single image, and the purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics and benchmarking. After analyzing these algorithms and identifying their limitations, we conclude with several promising directions for future research},

	doi = {10.1109/AIPR.2003.1284262},
	abstract = {This paper presents a novel neural network based technique for face detection that eliminates limitations pertaining to the skin color variations among people. We propose to model the skin color in the three dimensional RGB space which is a color cube consisting of all the possible color combinations. Skin samples in images with varying lighting conditions, from the Old Dominion University skin database, are used for obtaining a skin color distribution. The primary color components of each plane of the color cube are fed to a three-layered network, trained using the backpropagation algorithm with the skin samples, to extract the skin regions from the planes and interpolate them so as to provide an optimum decision boundary and hence the positive skin samples for the skin classifier. The use of the color cube eliminates the difficulties of finding the non-skin part of training samples since the interpolated data is consider skin and rest of the color cube is consider non-skin. Subsequent face detection is aided by the color, geometry and motion information analyses of each frame in a video sequence. The performance of the new face detection technique has been tested with real-time data of size 320/spl times/240 frames from video sequences captured by a surveillance camera. It is observed that the network can differentiate skin and non-skin effectively while minimizing false detections to a large extent when compared with the existing techniques. In addition, it is seen that the network is capable of performing face detection in complex lighting and background environments.},

After color normalization and face detection is performed, pixels of each face image are clustered in an unsupervised fashion. Pixels likely to be representative of skin color, rather than of distractors such as shadows, specularities, eyes, and lips, are identified by selecting the dominant clusters that have large number of pixels assigned per volume. A Gauss mixture model (GMM) of a person's skin color is formed from the pixels belonging to the selected clusters. When a set of exemplar images with skin color labels by an expert, we show that the label assigned by the same expert to a new, test face image can be predicted by comparison of the GMMs of the test image and the exemplars. Specifically, we use the label of the exemplar whose GMM has smallest KL divergence from that of the test image},

Methods of statistical analysis for lattice schemes are proposed, including a very flexible coding technique. The methods are illustrated by two numerical examples.

constituents of the set or interval. This is a potentially valuable tool for the evaluation of
risk and reliability in engineering applications when it is not possible to obtain a precise
measurement from experiments, or when knowledge is obtained from expert elicitation.
An important aspect of this theory is the combination of evidence obtained from multiple
sources and the modeling of conflict between them. This report surveys a number of
possible combination rules for Dempster-Shafer structures and provides examples of the
implementation of these rules for discrete and interval-valued data.},

However, the impact of fusion on the level of uncertainty within these techniques has not been studied in detail. While the use of Shannon entropy within the Bayesian fusion is well understood, the measures of uncertainty within the Dempster-Shafer formalism is not widely regarded. In this paper, an uncertainty based technique is proposed to quantify the evolution of DST fusion.

	abstract = {A novel approach for real-time skin segmentation in video sequences is described. The approach enables reliable skin segmentation despite wide variation in illumination during tracking. An explicit second order Markov model is used to predict evolution of the skin-color (HSV) histogram over time. Histograms are dynamically updated based on feedback from the current segmentation and predictions of the Markov model. The evolution of the skin-color distribution at each frame is parameterized by translation, scaling, and rotation in color space. Consequent changes in geometric parameterization of the distribution are propagated by warping and resampling the histogram. The parameters of the discrete-time dynamic Markov model are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation and also evolve over time. The accuracy of the new dynamic skin color segmentation algorithm is compared to that obtained via a static color model. Segmentation accuracy is evaluated using labeled ground-truth video sequences taken from staged experiments and popular movies. An overall increase in segmentation accuracy of up to 24 percent is observed in 17 out of 21 test sequences. In all but one case, the skin-color classification rates for our system were higher, with background classification rates comparable to those of the static segmentation.},
